<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Given the discouraging record of the traditional pension system and the limited coverage of the private-sector pension schemes, there is need for robust web-based pension fundmanagement system that can handle the pension process efficiently. This work focus on the design and implementation of a web-based pension fund management application to replace the manual system, thus getting rid of the hurdles involved in the traditional pension management process.

The purpose of this program is to develop a system that would keep records of employees or pensioners data including their pension plan, allowances, gratuity, taxes, net pay, rent pay and also calculate the pay of the pensioners taking into consideration the pensionerâ€™s data.

The Project Have the following Services:
## Eureka Server: 
Eureka server is an application that holds the information about all client-service applications. Here, Eureka Server will run on the port: 8761.
It will hold the information for the services 1, service 2 and API Gateway.

## API Gateway:
An API gateway is an API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services. An API gateway acts as a reverse proxy to accept all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result. 
In Simple words, the API Gateway will redirect our calls to the appropriate services.
Here, the API Gateway will run on port 8083.

## PensionPortalService1 :
This Service is connected via a common H2 DB in which ##PensionPortalService2 loads the data. The Service1 takes the Aadhar/Pan number of the user and returns some calculated amounts based on the request document. In case the Aadhar/PAM is invalid, it returns an error message.
App will run on port: 7090
## Note: Since the database is common for service 1 and service 2, we need to deploy service 2 before service 1 otherwise service 1 will throw error while deploying H2.


## PensionPortalService2 :
This Service loads the data into the H2 from a CSV file. It also takes Aadhar/PAN and returns the User details in case of valid data.
App will run on port: 8090

## Data in H2
H2 can be accessed with the url: localhost:8090/h2-console

### Built With

Web application is developed in Springboot with microservice architecture. Springboot have the ability to create a stand-alone application with reduce amount of code. Microservice architecture is used to make the application scalable and efficient.

A brief detail of the tech stacks are below:
* Spring boot with microservice architecture
* Spring security for auth service
* JWT validation for extra security
* git for version control.
